# Scoop Theory Favicon

## Current Issue:
The website is showing a generic icon and "v0 App" title instead of "Scoop Theory" branding.

## Solution:
1. Add custom favicon.ico file 
2. Update meta tags (already done locally)
3. Deploy SEO optimizations

## Favicon Options:
- Use your logo as favicon
- Create ice cream cone icon
- Use "ST" initials in a circle

Place your favicon.ico file in the /public folder to replace the current one.

## Files to check:
- /public/favicon.ico (needs to be your custom icon)
- /public/logo.png (for social sharing)
- index.html (SEO tags already updated locally)
